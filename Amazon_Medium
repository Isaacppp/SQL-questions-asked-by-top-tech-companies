  SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY category ORDER BY total DESC) AS ranking,
    category,
    product,

    SELECT
      category,
      product,
      SUM(spend) AS total

      product_spend
    WHERE
      transaction_date BETWEEN '01/01/2022 00:00:00' AND '12/31/2022 23:59:29'
    GROUP BY
      product, category
    ORDER BY category, total DESC) AS a) AS b
WHERE
  b.ranking IN (1,2)
ORDER BY category, total DESC;

-- Mistake: Forgot to add DESC after 'ORDER BY total' that led opposite result
